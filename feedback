- ( need design ) Mandatory field indication
- Header size difference to live site.
  - Need to know if I have done something wrong, css issue of meant to be that size.
- (done)Second level header (h2)
  - (done)Before you contact us
  - (done)Your message to us
- ( need design ) Drop downs
  - I have done some research into this and my understanding is:
     - less than five items it should be check boxes or radio group.
     - five to twenty six items drop down
     - more than twenty six items context
  - I will defer to design on this.
- (done) Privacy policy should link to ( https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/privacy-policy/ )
- Favicon
- ( need content ) Title wording
- (done) breadcrumbs should be Home > Contact us
- (done) Examples should be a reveal













Feedback - I can't see any indication of which fields are optional/required? Is that to come or part of design standards etc.?

Yep, need to ask design dudes about how that should be displayed as not seen an example of that stuff yet. (edited)

Laura Hajba [4:52 PM]
Thanks @paulmoore wording looks good so far

Agree with @Robin Faulks about what should be optional/mandatory being included


Robin Faulks [4:53 PM]
@paulmoore Feedback - May be just due to azure platform, but header sizing seems slightly different to live site. When you flick between the two you can see the difference in height etc.


Laura Hajba [4:53 PM]
Plus the 'What are you contacting us about?' needs to be a second-level heading like 'Before you contact us', as does 'your message to us'.

The idea with the examples section is that it would be a dropdown reveal/accordion but I know the functionality is to be added and design to be confirmed
Will let you know as soon as I know on updates to wording



Robin Faulks [4:55 PM]
@laurahajba Aren't those two phrases the field label/questions though? Same as 'Your name'?
@paulmoore Feedback - Need to remember to add the correct favicon for the page, e.g. the same mini NHS lozenge as the live site.

Laura Hajba [4:57 PM]
@Robin Faulks Yes they are the field labels/questions but I would think they need to stand out more than they currently do? (edited)

Robin Faulks [4:58 PM]
@laurahajba Content/design decision on that one then.

@paulmoore Feedback - Privacy Policy Agreement section needs to link to the NHS App privacy policy - https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/privacy-policy/

@Robin Faulksthanks just to make sure everyone can see the questions clearly, and thanks :point_up_2: I was going to mention we need to add that link too
